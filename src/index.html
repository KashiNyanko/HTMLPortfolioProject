    <p>
      Hi, Kashi Nyanko here. Just like what you've probably read up there, I'm a geek, a gamer, and I code as a hobby. Also, yes, I sing (also play a few instruments), though not professionally, but music is a huge part of who I am and what I do. Reading, apparently, is also my thing. Fantasy, romance, sci-fi, and any good stories out there can be on my reading list. Apart from my hobbies, I am a student of Business Information System, learning everything from theories of agile project management, to practical skills such as implementing databases on websites.
